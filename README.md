# Summarization Seq2seq Model - PyTorch

This is a Chinese news summarization model written in PyTorch(1.6).
I didn't use any tricky library/function, so it should be ok under various PyTorch version.

TODO:
- [] Use pretrained embedding instead of training from scratch
- [] Add top-k/top-p decoding
- [] GPT-2 w/ improved mask
- [] r-drop
- [] Extractive Summarization w/ BERT
